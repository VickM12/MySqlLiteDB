# MySqlLiteDb

I wanted to learn how to build a Structured Query Language (SQL) database engineâ€¦  
so I started building one.

## What This Is

**MySqlLiteDb** â€“ a **zero-dependency, file-backed SQL toy** forged in C#.

**Current feats**

| Feature | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT` (positional **and** named), `SELECT *` | |
| `UPDATE`, `DELETE` | Single-column equality predicates |
| Types | `GUID`, `TEXT`, `INT` |
| Storage | Flat `.tbl` files; first line is the schema header |

---

## Why I Built It

I wanted to see *every* gear turn:

1. **Lexer** â€“ slices raw SQL into tokens.  
2. **Parser** â€“ turns tokens into instructions.  
3. **Storage** â€“ saves rows, rewrites tables.  
4. **Engine** â€“ command loop that ties it all together.

Learning > polish. Expect sharp edges.
